        "description": "An advanced form of the transformation technique. When cast you transform your body into a physical object such as a weapon or object of Small or Medium size. While transformed into an object you take on its physical properties and function as this object. If transformed into a weapon you also take on its weapon properties. Others can wield and use you as a weapon so long as you maintain concentration on this jutsu. You cannot transform into any object that separates into multiple pieces, disconnects or has multiple moving mechanical parts, such as an electric fan or a Safe. If you do, these additional pieces or functions do not work or cannot be moved by any means. While transformed you cannot move or act or speak. You are aware of your immediate surroundings and can hear as normal, but are unable to cast jutsu or make attacks of any kind while transformed. At Higher Ranks: For each rank you cast this jutsu above D-Rank, increase the cost of this jutsu by 3. When Cast at B-Rank you can transform into large or smaller objects."

On a failed save they are thrown back 5 feet from the target space and falling Prone. • Fire: Each creature within 5 feet of the selected space makes a Dexterity Saving Throw.

The jutsu has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn’t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.\n\nSome typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines how the target behaves. If the target can’t follow your command, the jutsu ends.\n\n• **Approach:** The target moves towards you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.\n• **Drop:** The creature drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.\n• **Grovel:** The target falls Prone and then ends its turn.\n• **Flee:** The target turns and spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest means available.\n• **Halt:** The target doesn’t move or take actions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.\n\n**At Higher Ranks:** For each rank you cast this jutsu above C-Rank, increase the cost of this jutsu by 3 and the number of creatures you target by +1."

Select one target creature in range. Target creature makes a Dexterity save being stunned for the duration and gains a rank of Chilled as a result of being encased in ice on a failed save. A creature stunned inside the ice is deafened but can otherwise see everything they normally could while frozen.\nThe ice trapping the creature has an AC equal to your Ninjutsu save DC and 10 Hit points. If its hit points are reduced to 0 this jutsu ends. Any excess damage is dealt to the target creature. The target creature on its turn, makes a Strength saving throw to break out of the ice at the end of its turns."
