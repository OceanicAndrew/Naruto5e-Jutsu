Creatures, other than you, that enter or start their turn within the field of smoke take 5 Fire damage, plus an additional 5 Fire damage for every 5 feet they willingly move within this radius, as the air they breathe burns their lungs. This damage cannot be reduced by any means. Creatures who possess a breathing apparatus do not take damage from walking in this jutsu's area of effect. Also, when you deal fire damage to creatures within this radius, you deal an additional die of fire damage, once per turn, and ignore resistance to fire damage.
